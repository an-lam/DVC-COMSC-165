  is found before num characters have been copied, destination is
  padded with zeros until a total of num characters have been written to it.
  No null-character is implicitly appended at the end of destination
  if source is longer than num. Thus, in this case, destination shall not be
  considered a null
  terminated C string (reading it as such would overflow).
  destination and source shall not overlap
